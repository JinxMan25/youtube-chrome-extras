# YouTube Chrome Extension

This Chrome extension allows you to seek to any point in a video by doing a phrase search that matches may match any dialogue in the video. It also allows you to seek by searching through image captions. Image captions are created using a generative CNN model for discerning frames of the YouTube video. Karpathys neuraltalk2 was used to do the image captioning.
